### 46 simple programming exercises with solutions

    This is just a simple exercise for programming learners to familiar with string and text manipulation. The structure of the exercises is great from low complexity to intermediate level. Even though the <a href="http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/">author</a> made it for python programming but you can exercise on other programming languages too. For programmers working at data mining, data science, bioinformatics, natural language processing and computational linguistics, information retrival and so on.

    Another aspect of these exercises is that it encourages the learners to use only small building blocks of programming lanages instead of built-in functions.
    For instance, there is a python built-in function called max() to get the highest value from a list but how you solve without that function.

    In my opinion, programmers should know about low-level programming concept or what is the exeution path of a cerain functions or methods. Without knowing that, the performance or execution time is difficult to optimize for low level. "My program works but it is super slow and I don't know why" problem can be solved (a bit). Learning low level programming language is not easy and take time but high-level prorgammers like me, should know and understand a cerain level of low level exeution.

    This is not the solution yet but it's a good starting point.
